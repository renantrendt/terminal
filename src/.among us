New feature:
When you are at the matrix 'realm', after all letters have fell, a text appears
 saying "You have been locked into the Matrix realm. Get to the portal to escape"
  "move w/ <- and ->, or A D". 
You are an spaceshi, moves up automatically and you only control left & right,
 from the top of the screen 6 debress (PLEASE MAKE THEM AS WELL MADE AS POSSIBLE) w/
  the colors of black & yellow, those 6 debress fall randomly in a line falling form
  top to bottom they are 2x the size of the spaceship, move relativily fast, each 5.5 
  seconds 6 more debress fall at also a random pos. spachip has 3 lives, when touches 
  the portal (MAKE A GOOD DESING) the matrix bg dispears
